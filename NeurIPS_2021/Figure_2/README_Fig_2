Description of the code and data for Figure 2:

The Figure 2 is mainly about the tests on sensitivity of hyper-parameters for QD method.

Code and plots:
--- To run the code, enter the 'QD_sensitivity_tests' folder and run the 'main_QD_sensitivity.py';
--- Each run will produce a .txt result file for given data set ('boston by default')
--- To reproduce the results, simply assign the data set name to the "data_name" variable at the beginning of this code before running the main file.
--- Accepted data names are: 'boston', 'concrete', 'energy', 'kin8nm', 'naval', 'power', 'protein', 'wine', 'yacht', 'MSD'
--- We also have the pre-generated results saved in the './QD_sensitivity_tests/Pre_generated_results/' folder
--- Another copy of pre-generated result files are in the default folder ('./Figure_2/') for plotting. The boxplots for
    Figure 2 and the boxplots for MPIW, RMSE will be reproduced by running the 'Figure_2_plots.py'
