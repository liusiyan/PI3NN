This is the code for our PI3NN method used for he comparison.

All of our experiments on PI3NN method with UCI datasets were conducted on a single Ubuntu workstation, only one case ("MSD") was trained on a single NVIDIA RTX3090 due to its relatively larger data size. Rest of the cases were trained on a single Intel I9-10980xe CPU. You can enable the GPU training by commenting the above line : tf.config.set_visible_devices([], 'GPU')

To reproduce the results, simply assign the data set name to the "data_name" variable at the beginning of this code before running the main file.

Accepted data names are: 'boston', 'concrete', 'energy', 'kin8nm', 'naval', 'power', 'protein', 'wine', 'yacht', 'MSD'
The results will be generated in the ./Results_PI3NN/ including the summary of the training results (.txt files), plotted loss curves (./Results_PI3NN/loss_curves/) and loss history for each case (.csv format in ./Results_PI3NN/loss_history/).

We also prepared pre-generated results for your reference (in ./Pre_generated_results/)

Note that if the GPU is used in the training, slightly different results maybe obtained (for example the MSD case in our experiment), exact same results can bereproduced by forcing the training on CPU.

The results for PI3NN method from our Table 1 can be obtained by running this code or using our pre-generated results.

Have fun!
