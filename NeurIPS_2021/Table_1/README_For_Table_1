The Table 1 was constructed from the raw results generated from all 3 methods (./Pre-genrated_results_Table_1)

The results can be reproduced for all methods by running:

--- QD method: ./QD/main_QD.py
--- DER method: ./DER/main_DER.py
--- PI3NN method: ./PI3NN/main_PI3NN.py

More description can be found in the README files within each folder for the 3 methods.
