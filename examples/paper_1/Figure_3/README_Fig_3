Description of the code and data for Figure 3:

The Figure 3 is mainly about the OOD identification comparison between PI3NN, QD and DER method.


Code and plots:
--- To run the code for each method:
----- (1) QD method: './QD_OOD/main_QD_FUN_OOD.py'
----- (2) DER method: './DER_OOD/DER_FUN_OOD.py'
----- (3) PI3NN method: ./PI3NN_OOD/PI3NN_OOD_Pytorch.py

Note that the code is used to demonstrate the OOD identification capabilities, thus we did not fix the random seed, slightly different results can be obtained in each run. Meanwhile, the plots might look slightly different for the PI3NN method when assigning different bias values for the network.

--- To generate the plots with pre-generated results
run the './Figure_3_plots.py'
